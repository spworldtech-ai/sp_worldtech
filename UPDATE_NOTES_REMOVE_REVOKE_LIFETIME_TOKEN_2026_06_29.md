# SP WorldTech Update - Remove Tyna Token Revoke

Date: 2026-06-29

Changes made:

- Removed any active token disconnect/revoke behavior for Tyna Systems balance forwarding.
- Added backend protection so revoke requests are rejected and do not deactivate the token.
- Existing Tyna token connections are kept/restored as `active` when status is checked or auto-forward runs.
- Token status remains lifetime active.
- No login, signup, dashboard design, banking, removed finance module, academy, jobs, payment logic, or database structure was changed.
