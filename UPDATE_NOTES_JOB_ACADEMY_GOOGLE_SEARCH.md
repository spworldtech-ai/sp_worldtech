# Job and Academy Google Search Update

This update confirms and improves Google indexing readiness for the public Job and Academy pages.

## Public pages allowed for Google Search
- `jobs.html`
- `academy.html`
- Public academy course pages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git & GitHub, Node/Express, React, MongoDB, Python, Django, C, C++, C#/.NET, AI Prompt Engineering, and Premium School pages.

## Protected pages blocked from Google Search
Dashboard/login/protected pages remain excluded from sitemap and blocked/noindexed where appropriate, including:
- `job-dashboard.html`
- `academy-dashboard.html`
- `dashboard.html`
- `auth.html`
- `signup.html`
- calculator/admin/staff/user dashboard pages

## Improvement added
`academy.html` now includes static public course links in the HTML, so Google can discover the course pages even before JavaScript/API content loads.

## Important
Google Search visibility still requires deployment, Google Search Console domain verification, and sitemap submission:
